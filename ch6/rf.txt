To illustrate the power of the atomic idea, suppose that we have a drop of water a quarter of an inch on
 the side. If we look at it very closely we see nothing but water—smooth, continuous water. Even if we magnify it with the best optical microscope
 available—roughly two thousand times—then the water drop will
 be roughly forty feet across, about as big as a large room, and if
 we looked rather closely, we would still see relatively smooth water—but here and there small
 football-shaped things swimming back and forth. Very interesting. These are paramecia
. You may stop at this point and get so curious about the paramecia with their wiggling cilia
 and
 twisting bodies that you go no further, except perhaps to
 magnify the paramecia still more and see inside. This, of course, is
 a subject for biology, but for the present we pass on and look still more closely at the
 water material itself, magnifying it two thousand times again. Now the drop of water
 extends about fifteen miles across, and if we look very closely at
 it we see a kind of teeming, something which no longer has a smooth appearance—it looks something like
 a crowd at a football game as seen from a very great distance.
