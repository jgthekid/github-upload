getLine.c               getLine: get line into s, return length (function only)
atoi.c                  atoi: convert s to integer; version 2
ex4.2.c                 extend atof to handle scientific notation of the form 123.45e-6 where a floating-point number may be followed by e or E and an optionally signed exponent
